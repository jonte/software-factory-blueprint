Manifests
=========

Repo [#repotool]_ is a tool for using several git repositories in the same
build. It features a `manifest` format using XML where one defines the git
repositories and revisions one wants to use. It is possible to include manifests
in other manifests.

Feature overview
----------------
* Download several git repos simultaneously.
* Use different revisions for different repos.

    * Revisions can be branches, tags or commit hashes.

* Combine manifests together.

    * Create more specialized manifests from a common base.

* Default settings for revision etc.
* Separate remotes and actual repos.

Usage in yocto
--------------
When doing yocto builds, the repo tool is useful to have the various yocto
layers synced towards the same yocto release (typically, a poky release).

Revisions in repo manifests can be branch names, tags, or commit hashes. For
maximum reproducibility, commit hashes are a good solution, but in order to be
able to follow layers as they move, branch names are suitable.

If one wants to support several yocto releases, it is possible to use different
branches in the manifest repo, where the manifest in each branch would then
point to the corresponding branch (or a commit on that branch) in the layers
used.

Example
^^^^^^^
Below is an example of a manifest from PELUX [#pelux-manifests]_ showcasing the
format.

.. literalinclude:: snippets/manifest.xml
    :language: xml

Note the ``path`` setting, which tells repo where to put the checked out git repo,
relative to the current working directory.

Using the repo tool
-------------------
In the yocto setting, only two of the repo commands are typically used: ``repo
init`` and ``repo sync``. The first sets up repo in the current working
directory, and the second downloads all the git repositories pointed out by the
manifest selected.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir <some-directory>
    $ cd <some-directory>
    $ repo init -u <manifest repo URL> -m <manifest> -b <branch>
    $ repo sync

The curious reader can poke around in ``.repo`` after running repo sync, where
one can also change what manifest being used by changing the symlink for
``manifest.xml``.
