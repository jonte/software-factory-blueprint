PELUX provides a Software Development Kit (SDK), for quick and easy development
of software components for a PELUX (or PELUX-based) system. The SDK is mainly
targeted towards service implementers but can be used for developing
applications and other kinds of software components as well.

For info on your SDK, see :ref:`sdk`.
